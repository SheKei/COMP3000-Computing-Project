# COMP3000-Computing-Project

## Project Vision:
For university students who have problems keeping track of their progress being made on their enrolled modules.

Chronademy is a web-based academic time management system that will track the number of hours a student is spending on a daily, weekly and overall basis on a module. 
Users will be able to track the progress of assignments as well as view reminders and upcoming classes. Users will also be able to prioritise tasks and set deadlines.
