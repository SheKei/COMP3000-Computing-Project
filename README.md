# COMP3000-Computing-Project

## Project Vision:
Hourly is a web-based academic time management system aimed towards university students who have trouble keeping records of their progress made during their studies. 
It is different to other academic systems as these tend to focus on those in secondary education and often employing gaming gimmicks to encourage the regular output of work. 

Hourly intends to encourage the practising of time management by keeping track of the hours spent on assignments and upcoming deadlines so that the students are aware on what to prioritise. 

No registration or sign in required, a dummy account is used in place [GitHub](web.socem.plymouth.ac.uk/FYP/STong/Hourly/View/home.php)
